# My-first

A Java SE console application designed to manage core academic operations, including student and course information, enrollments, and grading. This project serves as a practical demonstration of advanced Java features and software design best practices.

🎯 Core Capabilities

Student & Course Administration: Create, view, modify, and deactivate student and course records.

Enrollment & Academic Records: Handle course enrollments, apply business rules (e.g., credit limits), record grades, calculate GPA, and generate student transcripts.

Data Persistence & Utilities: Import and export data in CSV format, create timestamped backups, and analyze backup storage usage.

💻 Technical Implementation

Programming Paradigms: Built on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, utilizing polymorphism and encapsulation.

Java Features: Leverages modern Java APIs including Streams for data processing, NIO.2 for file operations, and the Date/Time API.

Software Design: Incorporates Design Patterns such as Singleton and Builder for efficient object management, alongside Enums for type safety.

Advanced Techniques: Implements robust exception handling and recursive algorithms for file system tasks.

📋 Functional Modules

Student Management: Maintain a registry of students, print detailed profiles, and generate academic transcripts.

Course Management: Manage course offerings with search and filtering capabilities (by instructor, department, etc.) using the Java Streams API.

Enrollment & Grading: Control student enrollment in courses, enforce academic policies, record marks, and compute final grades and GPA.

File Operations (NIO.2): Handle CSV-based data import/export, automatically back up files into organized folders, and recursively calculate backup directory sizes.

Console Interface: A user-friendly, menu-driven CLI that navigates through all system features using loops and switch-case logic.
